        "**This notebook is specifically designed for NVIDIA DGX Spark systems.**\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook should be run **BEFORE** `01_Setup_Environment.ipynb` if you're on a DGX Spark system. It ensures PyTorch is installed with proper CUDA support for the DGX Spark's GPU.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What This Notebook Does\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Detects DGX Spark System**: Identifies ARM64 architecture and NVIDIA GB10 GPU\n",
        "2. **Checks Current PyTorch**: Determines if CPU-only or CUDA-enabled version is installed\n",
        "3. **Installs CUDA-Enabled PyTorch**: Installs PyTorch with CUDA 13.0 support (cu130)\n",
        "4. **Verifies GPU Access**: Confirms PyTorch can see and use the GPU\n",
        "5. **Provides System Information**: Shows GPU details, CUDA version, and PyTorch configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "## About DGX Spark\n",
        "\n",
        "The **NVIDIA DGX Spark** is a compact AI workstation featuring:\n",
        "- **Grace CPU**: ARM64-based processor (aarch64 architecture)\n",
        "- **NVIDIA GB10 GPU**: Blackwell architecture with 128 GB unified memory\n",
        "- **Compute Capability**: SM_121 (12.1) - newer than older PyTorch builds recognized\n",
        "- **CUDA Version**: 13.0\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why This Notebook is Needed:**\n",
        "- Default `pip install torch` installs CPU-only version on ARM64\n",
        "- DGX Spark requires CUDA 13.0 enabled PyTorch (cu130 index)\n",
        "- PyTorch 2.9+ has official support for CUDA 13.0 and DGX Spark\n",
        "- Without proper setup, GPU acceleration won't work\n",
        "\n",
        "**After This Notebook:**\n",
        "- Proceed to `01_Setup_Environment.ipynb` for full environment setup\n",
        "- Your PyTorch will have GPU support enabled\n"

        "1. ✅ Detected DGX Spark system (ARM64 + GB10 GPU)\n",
        "2. ✅ Checked current PyTorch installation\n",
        "3. ✅ Installed PyTorch with CUDA 13.0 support (if needed)\n",
        "4. ✅ Verified GPU detection and access\n",
        "5. ✅ Generated system configuration report\n",

        "**Key Points for DGX Spark:**\n",
        "- **Architecture**: ARM64 (aarch64) - different from x86_64\n",
        "- **GPU**: NVIDIA GB10 (Blackwell, compute capability 12.1)\n",
        "- **CUDA**: 13.0 - use `cu130` PyTorch index\n",
        "- **PyTorch**: 2.9+ has official DGX Spark support\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **CPU-only PyTorch installed:**\n",
        "   - Solution: Uninstall and reinstall from `cu130` index\n",
        "   - Command: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu130`\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **GPU not detected after installation:**\n",
        "   - Solution: Restart kernel (Kernel → Restart Kernel)\n",
        "   - Then re-run verification cell\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compute capability warnings:**\n",
        "   - These are informational (GB10 is 12.1, PyTorch supports up to 12.0)\n",
        "   - GPU will still work, may use compatibility mode\n",
        "   - Future PyTorch versions will fully support 12.1\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "1. If GPU is working: Proceed to `01_Setup_Environment.ipynb`\n",
        "2. If issues persist: Check NVIDIA drivers (`nvidia-smi`)\n",
        "3. For optimal performance: Consider using NVIDIA's prebuilt containers\n",
