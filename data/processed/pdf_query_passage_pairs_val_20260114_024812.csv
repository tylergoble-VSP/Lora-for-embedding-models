"*Here are 3 questions based on the passage, suitable for an undergraduate student:**","No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow And at first, this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough It touches one’s sense of honor,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes And more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
awe of you The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it But even this wears off
in time What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
I mean, in the scales of the New Testament Do you think the archangel
Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance Who ain’t
a slave Tell me that Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
order me about-however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same way-either in a physical or
metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,
and be content https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt 15/344
Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that I ever heard of On the contrary, passengers themselves must
pay And there is all the difference in the world between paying and
being paid The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable

a march on him-bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings It seemed no bad idea; but upon

morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began

**Describe the visual connection the narrator makes between Queequeg's arm and the counterpane. What,"CHAPTER 4 The Counterpane Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner You had almost
thought I had been his wife The counterpane was of patchwork, full of
odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
two parts of which were of one precise shade-owing I suppose to his
keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times-this same arm of his, I

say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
quilt Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I
could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I
could tell that Queequeg was hugging me My sensations were strange Let me try to explain them When I was a
child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle The
circumstance was this I had been cutting up some caper or other-I
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,-my
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere I felt dreadfully But
there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before I could hope for a resurrection Sixteen hours in bed the small
of my back ached to think of it",mobydick,mobydick::sec006::chunk00024,sec_006,“WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”,16,32,490,1998

a ship that’s bound for Tarshish There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
unheeded meaning here By all accounts Tarshish could have been no
other city than the modern Cadiz That’s the opinion of learned men And where is Cadiz, shipmates Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea Because Joppa, the modern
Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,
the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar See ye not
then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God Miserable man most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas So
disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had
been arrested ere he touched a deck How plainly he’s a fugitive no
baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,-no friends accompany him
to the wharf with their adieux At last, after much dodging search, he
finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s
evil eye Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile Strong intuitions of the
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00007,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,409,1661

shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,
Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep He sees no black sky and raging sea,

rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
the seas after him Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides
of the ship-a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast
asleep But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead
ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper arise!’ Startled from his lethargy

is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks Wave
after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs
roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet

What specific details in the passage support this description of Queequeg's demeanor?,"I had
noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,
with the other seamen in the inn He made no advances whatever;
appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there
was something almost sublime in it Here was a man some twenty thousand
miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is-which was the only
way he could get there-thrown among people as strange to him as though
he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
always equal to himself Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that But,
perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of
so living or so striving So soon as I hear that such or such a man
gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the
dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”

storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of

otherwise I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
Presbyterian Church How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood But what is worship thought I Do you
suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
earth-pagans and all included-can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood Impossible But what is worship?-to do
the will of God-_that_ is worship And what is the will of God?-to do
to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me-_that_ is
the will of God Now, Queequeg is my fellow man And what do I wish
that this Queequeg would do to me Why, unite with me in my particular
Presbyterian form of worship Consequently, I must then unite with him
in his; ergo, I must turn idolator So I kindled the shavings; helped
prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
and all the world But we did not go to sleep without some little chat How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends Man and wife, they say, there open the
very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often
lie and chat over old times till nearly morning Thus, then, in our

side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;
climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the

hacked in pieces In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
Queequeg budged not Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
told him he might make himself at home But this fine young savage-this
sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin They put him down
among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him But like Czar Peter
content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained
no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of
enlightening his untutored countrymen For at bottom-so he told me-he
was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the
arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more
than that, still better than they were But, alas the practices of
whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both
miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s
heathens Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the
sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they
spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for
lost Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a
pagan And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish Hence the queer

wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish Hence the queer
ways about him, though now some time from home By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts He answered no, not
yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,
had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
pagan Kings before him But by and by, he said, he would return,-as
soon as he felt himself baptized again For the nonce, however, he
proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans They
had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
sceptre now I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
movements He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation Upon
this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port
for an adventurous whaleman to embark from He at once resolved to
accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my
every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of
both worlds To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted
with the sea, as known to merchant seamen His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg
embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon

What specific imagery does the author use to convey this motion?,"On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow
beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
more dignified than a whitewashed negro But there were some boobies
and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come
from the heart and centre of all verdure Queequeg caught one of these
young saplings mimicking him behind his back I thought the bumpkin’s
hour of doom was come Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught
him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern
in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe
and passed it to me for a puff “Capting Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
“Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
“Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that Don’t you know
you might have killed that chap?”
“What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain, “ah",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00029,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,437,1737

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, how did the inhabitants of Nantucket progressively expand their involvement with the sea as a means of livelihood?","What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
take to the sea for a livelihood They first caught crabs and quohogs
in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood; most monstrous and most mountainous That Himmalehan, salt-sea
Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,
and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland Let America
add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English
overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s For the sea
is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
right of way through it Merchant ships are but extension bridges;
armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,
other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
their living from the bottomless deep itself The Nantucketer, he alone
resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to
it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation _There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood
would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among
the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00033,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,482,2078

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, how is the ownership of whaling vessels in Nantucket typically structured, and who commonly holds shares?","“And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added-“come
along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
cabin Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
nail or two in the ship People in Nantucket invest their money in
whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
stocks bringing in good interest Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by
things altogether alien and heterogeneous For some of these same
Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters They
are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
Scripture names-a singularly common fashion on the island-and in
childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman And when
these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a
globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and
beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language-that man makes
one in a whole nation’s census-a mighty pageant creature, formed for
noble tragedies",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00045,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,511,2282
What does this interaction reveal about their relationship?,"Out of the cabin, ye canting,
drab-coloured son of a wooden gun-a straight wake with ye!”
As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,
I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of Peleg But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawing He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways As
for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated “Whew!” he whistled at last-“the
squall’s gone off to leeward, I think Bildad, thou used to be good at
sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye My jack-knife here needs
the grindstone That’s he; thank ye, Bildad Now then, my young man,
Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
for the three hundredth lay.”
“Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship
too-shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
“To be sure,” said Peleg “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
“What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himself never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg “Has he ever
whaled it any?” turning to me",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00052,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,443,1660

impression upon Queequeg Because, in the first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered

than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,

religion than I did He looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such
a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
piety At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty

make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the

“Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam “He must show that he’s converted Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present
in communion with any Christian church?”
“Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here
be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churches “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00063,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,452,1911

hand; I never heard a better sermon Deacon Deuteronomy-why Father
Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something Come
aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers I say, tell Quohog
there-what’s that you call him tell Quohog to step along By the great
anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there looks like good stuff that; and
he handles it about right I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did
you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat did you ever strike a
fish?”
Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:-
“Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere You see him well,
spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he
darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
eye; why, dad whale dead.”
“Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
gangway “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers We must
have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats Look ye,
Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was
given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”

enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00065,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,465,1685

troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
rubbed his eyes “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
“Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
“Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye She sails to-day The Captain
came aboard last night.”
“What Captain?-Ahab?”
“Who but him indeed?”
I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck “Holloa Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger “He’s a lively chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
saying he went on deck, and we followed It was now clear sunrise Soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin CHAPTER 22 Merry Christmas",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00078,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,440,1750

as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he
was not yet completely recovered-so they said-therefore, Captain Ahab
stayed below And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the
merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a
considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
before they quit the ship for good with the pilot But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
Peleg was now all alive He seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding, and not Bildad “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at

to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
had calmly confronted through life A staid, steadfast man, whose life
for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
chapter of sounds Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some
cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest Uncommonly
conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,
the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
from ignorance Outward portents and inward presentiments were his And
if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more
did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,
tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,
and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some
honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often
evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery “I
will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a
whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and
useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the
encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more

perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a

without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still

whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
certainly say By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or
no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates But once
Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea Yet, this
wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman
insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab Nevertheless,
the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment So that no
white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever
Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out-which might hardly come to
pass, so he muttered-then, whoever should do that last office for the
dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00103,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,485,2100

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, why does the author believe attempting to classify whales based on features like baleen, humps, or fins is problematic?","From having the baleen in his mouth, the
Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen Of
these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several
varieties, most of which, however, are little known Broad-nosed whales
and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded
upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other
detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents How then The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
other and more essential particulars Thus, the sperm whale and the
humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these
has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases And it is just the
same with the other parts above mentioned In various sorts of whales,
they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of
them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
general methodization formed upon such a basis On this rock every one
of the whale-naturalists has split But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy-there, at least, we shall be able to hit the

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, why are mast-heads typically manned immediately upon a whaling vessel's departure from port, even if the cruising grounds are far away?","CHAPTER 35 The Mast-Head It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her-say, an empty vial
even-then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
here I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the
dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel
builders priority over the Egyptians And that the Egyptians were a
nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general
belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for
astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar
stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with
prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were
wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing
in sight",mobydick,mobydick::sec007::chunk00139,sec_007,"SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,",32,109,443,1852

ship-board except in some extraordinary case “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab “Mast-heads, there come down!”
When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck With bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat But this did not last long Vehemently pausing, he cried:-
“What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
“Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them “And what do ye next, men?”
“Lower away, and after him!”
“And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
“A dead whale or a stove boat!”

countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to

themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, how did initial encounters with Moby Dick differ from subsequent encounters, and what contributed to this shift?","And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one
of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any
other whale of that species But at length, such calamities did ensue
in these assaults-not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
limbs, or devouring amputations-but fatal to the last degree of
fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and
piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake
the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White
Whale had eventually come Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters For not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events,-as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there For not only
are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and
superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they
are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is
appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them Alone, in such
remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and
longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is
wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
a mighty birth",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00007,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,448,1978

    ""question"": ""According to Cuvier, how do other fish react when encountering a Sperm Whale?","Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
similar impressions effaced For in his Natural History, the Baron
himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks

precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general
experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the
superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their
vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man That to attempt it, would be
inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity On this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same

of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man That to attempt it, would be
inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity On this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit

the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the
waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his
vengeance But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
Season-on-the-Line No possible endeavor then could enable her
commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
Pacific in time to cruise there Therefore, he must wait for the next
ensuing season Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,
perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very
complexion of things Because, an interval of three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any
other waters haunted by his race So that Monsoons, Pampas,
Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,
might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
Pequod’s circumnavigating wake But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople For the peculiar
snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be

instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard
of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there
is no good ground to impeach Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisable Why such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oil No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance Like some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump
for their presumption But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
celebrity-Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,

modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the Mediterranean I am told, on good authority, that on
the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the

through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
whale-squid or cuttle-fish-lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
found at its surface If, then, you properly put these statements

thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and
long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether
to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage Or at least if
this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with him It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted But if such an hypothesis be
indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,

    ""question"": ""According to Ahab, why is it necessary to provide sailors with 'temporary interests and employments' during a long and abstract pursuit like the chase for Moby Dick?","For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are
more or less capricious and unreliable-they live in the varying outer
weather, and they inhale its fickleness-and when retained for any
object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and
passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary
interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily
suspended for the final dash Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing In times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
Ahab, is sordidness Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
for their more common, daily appetites For even the high lifted and
chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
perquisites by the way Had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic object-that final and romantic object, too many would have
turned from in disgust I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of
all hopes of cash-aye, cash They may scorn cash now; but let some
months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this
same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
soon cashier Ahab Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to Ahab personally Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00048,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,481,2225

is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active

whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then

own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was

coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing
the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee
fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a
little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and

had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew “There she
blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure For though it was
a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a

of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
influences were struggling in her-one to mount direct to heaven, the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal And had you watched
Ahab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring While his one live leg made lively
echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a
coffin-tap On life and death this old man walked But though the ship

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what types of information are commonly exchanged between whaling vessels that encounter each other?","And especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
talk about For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
importance to her And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground
itself, even though they are equally long absent from home For one of
them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now
far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of
the ship she now meets Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,
and have an agreeable chat For not only would they meet with all the
sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
privations and perils Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with Americans and English Though, to be sure, from the small number
of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when
they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself Besides, the English
whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his
nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant But where this
superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be
hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill
more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00079,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,488,2171

seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had
last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as
black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to
the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with
their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a
handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if
by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship For
himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not That was the last night he should spend in that den But the scheme met
with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were
ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
surrender And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first
man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come But to this
their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;
particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,
in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder
would but admit one man at a time And here, gentlemen, the foul play
of these miscreants must come out “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might

call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
intended when the device was first introduced It was introduced by an
old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the

comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
species of the Leviathan In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you

How does this method contribute to safety?,"Hemp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian
to behold The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness At first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is By experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons In length, the common sperm whale-line measures
something over two hundred fathoms Towards the stern of the boat it is
spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
the cheese As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in
running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub Some
harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all
possible wrinkles and twists In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs There is some advantage in
this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which
will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
concentrated one When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00129,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,512,2232
What comparisons does the author use to convey this experience?,"For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is
like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a
steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
wheel, is grazing you It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in
the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,
and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest
warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
never pierce you out Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual play-this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair But why say more All men

not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side CHAPTER 61 Stubb Kills a Whale If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what roles do the headsman/whale-killer and the harpooneer play during the initial departure of the whale-boat from the ship?","His heart had burst “He’s dead, bMr. Stubb,” said Daggoo “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made CHAPTER 62 The Dart A word concerning an incident in the last chapter According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar Now it needs a strong,
nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what
is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the
distance of twenty or thirty feet But however prolonged and exhausting
the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman
activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
started-what that is none know but those who have tried it For one, I
cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
time In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the
fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting
cry-“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his
oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the
crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
somehow into the whale",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00139,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,405,1645

*Questions:**,"Now as
the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,
so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
stripped by spiralizing it For the strain constantly kept up by the
windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck
and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the
windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and
every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass Into
this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
what follows Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
lowering The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt 186/344
tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other
is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the
main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the

the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,

called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass Into
this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
what follows Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
lowering The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what is the author's basis for comparing the markings on Sperm Whale skin to hieroglyphics?","These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to
use in the present connexion By my retentive memory of the
hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck
with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the
famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains
undecipherable This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another
thing Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm
Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially
his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by
reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
aspect I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,
which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
with vast floating icebergs-I should say, that those rocks must not a
little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular It also seems to me
that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact
with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
full-grown bulls of the species A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
whale It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
pieces, called blanket-pieces Like most sea-terms, this one is very
happy and significant For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity It is by reason of
this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what alternative explanations have continental commentators proposed to explain Jonah's survival besides being swallowed by a living whale?","But
this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
_dead_ whale-even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them Besides, it has
been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was
thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor
have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver-an
inflated bag of wind-which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was
saved from a watery doom Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
round But he had still another reason for his want of faith It was
this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the
Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much
more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the
Mediterranean coast How is that But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
that short distance of Nineveh He might have carried him round by
the way of the Cape of Good Hope But not to speak of the passage
through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up
the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the
complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of
the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any
whale to swim in Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of
Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and
so make modern history a liar But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason-a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
sun and the sea",mobydick,mobydick::sec008::chunk00229,sec_008,HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.,109,241,505,2218

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what is a typical reaction of a whale when struck by a harpoon, and why does this pose a danger to the whaling boat?","As is customary in
those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
whale on the outskirts of the shoal In about three minutes’ time,
Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
straight for the heart of the herd Though such a movement on the part
of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the
fishery For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a
delirious throb As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no
time to make long ones Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their
wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with They chiefly attended to
the shouting part of the business “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried
one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
and for an instant threatened to swamp us “Hard down with your tail,
there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed

How did this change aid in the harpooning process?,"It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly
diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning So
that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale
sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt 232/344
shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost
whales, were heard but not felt In this central expanse the sea
presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
heart of every commotion And still in the distracted distance we
beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive
pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to
shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs Owing to the
density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding
the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at
present afforded us We must watch for a breach in the living wall that
hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us
up Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by
small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square

likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former

What does the passage suggest about the significance of his gaze at each object?,"the metempsychosis Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage-and, foolish as I am, taught
thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope CHAPTER 99 The Doubloon Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him When he halted before the
binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of
his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted
gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only
dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them And some
certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass
in the Milky Way Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,
the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows And though now nailed amidst
all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,
yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
Quito glow Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with
thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last",mobydick,mobydick::sec009::chunk00031,sec_009,V.E._,241,338,506,2213
"**The passage uses the metaphor of a ""loom"" repeatedly. How does the author utilize this metaphor to comment on the relationship between creation, labor, and the potential for exposure or detection?** (This question asks students to analyze a key metaphor and","what palace may it deck wherefore all
these ceaseless toilings Speak, weaver!-stay thy hand!-but one single
word with thee Nay-the shuttle flies-the figures float from forth the
loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away The weaver-god,
he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
through it For even so it is in all material factories The spoken
words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words
are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
casements Thereby have villainies been detected Ah, mortal then, be
heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy
subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging-a gigantic idler Yet,
as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
himself a skeleton Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
object of vertu He laughed But more I marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine To and fro I paced

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what proportion of a Sperm Whale's total length is accounted for by its skull and jaw?","Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a
proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
of the general structure we are about to view In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body Of this seventy-two
feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty
feet of plain back-bone Attached to this back-bone, for something less
than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs
which once enclosed his vitals To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
for the time, but a long, disconnected timber The ribs were ten on a side The first, to begin from the neck, was
nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches From
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
spanned five feet and some inches In general thickness, they all bore
a seemly correspondence to their length The middle ribs were the most
arched In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form",mobydick,mobydick::sec009::chunk00059,sec_009,V.E._,241,338,508,2217
"**According to the passage, how did the geographical landscape of Earth differ in the distant past compared to the present?** (This question tests comprehension of the passage's description of a pre-historical Earth dominated by the whale.)","Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, how does the author characterize the Pacific Ocean's relationship to other bodies of water, such as the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic?","To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
ever after be the sea of his adoption It rolls the midmost waters of
the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms The same
waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans Thus this mysterious, divine
Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth Lifted by those eternal
swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles

consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming Launched at
length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese

fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed
her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a
vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
flaxen curls Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean

terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them-“Come hither,

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what is the primary function of lightning rods on ships, and how does this differ from their function on land?","Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water But
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require “The rods the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post “Are they overboard drop them

“Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the
weaker side Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges Let
them be, sir.”
“Look aloft!” cried Starbuck “The corpusants the corpusants!”
All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar “Blast the boat let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing

    ""question"": ""According to the passage, what is the relationship between the magnetic energy of a mariner's needle and electricity, and how does this relationship explain the observed phenomenon of compass malfunction?","Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
gloomily Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms The magnetic energy, as
developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
marvelled at, that such things should be Instances where the lightning
has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars
and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the
original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be
affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be
changed accordingly The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
one had only been juggling her Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
Flask-who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
feelings-likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced As for the men, though some
of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear
of Fate But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost
wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain
magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt 304/344

always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it

the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out

was swallowed up in the deep But few, perhaps, thought of that at the

evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
had heard the night before But again the old Manxman said nay The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see

recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew But no formal salutation
was exchanged “Where was he?-not killed!-not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing “How was it?”
It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of
whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt 311/344
while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head
of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to
leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat-a reserved one-had been
instantly lowered in chase After a keen sail before the wind, this
fourth boat-the swiftest keeled of all-seemed to have succeeded in
fastening-at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
anything about it In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens There was
some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet The recall signals
were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
three far to windward boats-ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
precisely opposite direction-the ship had not only been necessitated to
leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
increase her distance from it But the rest of her crew being at last

ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
mortar of Ahab’s iron soul Like machines, they dumbly moved about the
deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
even as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance
awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
being’s body And that shadow was always hovering there For not by
night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
below He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly say-We two watchmen never rest Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,
or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,-the
main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
cabin-scuttle,-his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;
his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved
coat and hat",mobydick,mobydick::sec009::chunk00150,sec_009,V.E._,241,338,468,1923

How does their behavior contrast with that of Fedallah?,"In this attitude the White Whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse With
unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the
uttermost stern And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while
the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the
two floating wrecks These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
fast to the oars to lash them across At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite But only
slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as
it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him
out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
sea",mobydick,mobydick::sec009::chunk00166,sec_009,V.E._,241,338,438,1824

billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;

out of the water-the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,

“What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck Man, man did
I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could
swear thou wert a poltroon Groan nor laugh should be heard before a

and an ill one.”
“Omen omen?-the dictionary If the gods think to speak outright to

give an old wives’ darkling hint.-Begone Ye two are the opposite poles

“As before, sir,-straight to leeward.”

and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more

time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more

that way to disencumber it of some snarls-when lo!-a sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks Caught and twisted-corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing

"**Describe the immediate response of Moby Dick upon recognizing the three boats. What actions does he take, and how does he react to the harpoons thrown by","Lower, all!”
As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
three crews Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
them he would take the whale head-and-head,-that is, pull straight up
to his forehead,-a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong
vision But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three
boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale
churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him
from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
of which those boats were made But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly
wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while
eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the
time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed

"*Here are 3 questions based on the passage, suitable for an undergraduate student:**","The harpoon, too!-toss over the litter there,-d’ye see it?-the forged
iron, men, the white whale’s-no, no, no,-blistered fool this hand did
dart it!-’tis in the fish!-Aloft there Keep him nailed-Quick!-all
hands to the rigging of the boats-collect the oars-harpooneers the
irons, the irons!-hoist the royals higher-a pull on all the
sheets!-helm there steady, steady for your life I’ll ten times girdle
the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay
him yet!”
“Great God but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
“never, never wilt thou capture him, old man-In Jesus’ name no more of
this, that’s worse than devil’s madness Two days chased; twice stove
to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
shadow gone-all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:-what more
wouldst thou have?-Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
swamps the last man Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the
sea Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world Oh, oh,-Impiety
and blasphemy to hunt him more!”
“Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
hour we both saw-thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes But in this
matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
hand-a lipless, unfeatured blank Ahab is for ever Ahab, man This
whole act’s immutably decreed ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
years before this ocean rolled Fool I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
under orders Look thou, underling that thou obeyest mine.-Stand round
me, men Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
lance; propped up on a lonely foot ’Tis Ahab-his body’s part; but
Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs I feel
